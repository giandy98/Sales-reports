Report on the outlets of an electronics distribution chain


This project consists of creating an interactive report for an electronics distribution chain in Italy. 
The report is to be based on the sales of leading products in the various shops, with the aim of analysing different aspects of sales. 
The project required the integration of data, the creation of interactive visualisations and the optimisation of usability through the addition of navigation features.
